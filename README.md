# the Hamiltonian form is a panoramic snapshot of the energy distribution

The physical picture of Hamiltonian is exceptionally clear:  an instantaneous panoramic snapshot of the energy distribution (similar to a weather snapshot). Within this framework, the physical meanings of the Schrödinger equation and General Relativity (GR) equation can be interpreted in a more intuitive and transparent manner.

13.10 Hamiltonian, Schrödinger Equation, and General Relativity Equations from the Perspective of This Model

13.10.1 From the perspective of this model, the Hamiltonian is an energy function defined in terms of the generalized coordinates (resonance frequency and resonance axis vector of Space Elementary Quanta, SEQ) and their corresponding generalized momenta. It fully characterizes the current local spatial configuration of energy distribution and acts as the generator of time evolution, determining the subsequent energy distribution and its evolutionary trend at the next moment. In this framework, the traditional notions of kinetic and potential energy terms are both manifested as different modes of frequency modulation of SEQ. The so-called "potential energy" fundamentally arises from elastic potential energy associated with spatial tensor deformations or twistor structures.

13.10.2 Schrödinger Equation: In this model's interpretation, the Schrödinger equation describes how the current energy distribution, along with its gradients—such as phase gradients (encoded in the Hamiltonian)—determines the probabilistic evolution of the next moment’s energy distribution and its gradients. The origin of probabilistic randomness lies in the non-uniqueness of maximum entropy paths within the system's dynamical evolution. Thus, quantum probability emerges not from intrinsic indeterminism, but from the multiplicity of valid pathways that satisfy thermodynamic and variational principles under constrained initial conditions.

13.10.3 Einstein's field equations of General Relativity—the metric tensor equation—and the geodesic equation essentially describe the same class of evolutionary dynamics as the Schrödinger equation: namely, that the present state of energy distribution and its gradient determines the future path of energy distribution evolution. The difference lies only in the encoding language: General Relativity formulates this law geometrically through spacetime curvature and affine connections, while the Schrödinger equation expresses it through quantum phase dynamics and probability amplitudes. Despite their distinct mathematical formulations and interpretive frameworks, both reflect a unified underlying principle—the causal propagation of energy configurations governed by extremal principles such as least action and entropy increase.

13.11 Due to the topological invariance of the spatial field in this model, the spatial coordinates of each field quantum are fixed (the space may deform, but the connectivity and adjacency relations remain unchanged). Each Space Elementary Quantum (SEQ) carries only two generalized coordinates: the field quantum resonance frequency (associated with field quantum spin and mutual spin synchronization, representing elastic potential energy at sub-Planckian elastic scales) and the field quantum resonance axis vector, denoted as (ωᵢ, n̂(i)). Consequently, the Hamiltonian formulation of this model is simpler, more intuitive, and more consistent with the physical process of energy redistribution and energy gradient configurations than those of traditional quantum field theory or general relativity, while naturally preserving global energy conservation and embedding thermodynamic arrow of time.         
Since the model is based on the fundamental assumption of spatial topological invariance, the physical picture associated with its Hamiltonian is exceptionally clear: it essentially represents an instantaneous snapshot of the energy distribution (similar to a weather snapshot). Within this framework, the physical meanings of the Schrödinger equation and Einstein's general relativity (GR) equation can be interpreted in a more intuitive and transparent manner.

13.12 In this model, the Hamiltonian form is essentially a panoramic snapshot of the energy distribution:
H(ωᵢ, n̂(i)) = ∑SEQᵢ K(ωᵢ, n̂(i)) + ∑SEQᵢ U(ωᵢ, n̂(i))

where:

K(ωᵢ, n̂(i)): The energy transport capacity determined by the frequency gradient and directionality (kinetic-like).

U(ωᵢ, n̂(i)): The energy storage arising from spatial elastic deformation or gauge coupling (potential-like).

In this framework, the system’s state vector is defined by a snapshot of the energy distribution configuration at a given moment. This snapshot inherently encodes the energy structure described by the Hamiltonian. Its time evolution is governed by two intrinsic dynamical principles (Section 3):

An energy conduction triggering mechanism based on local energy gradients;

A tendency to select paths of maximum entropy production.

Since the maximum entropy path is generally not unique, the system explores multiple near-optimal evolutionary paths in parallel at the Planck-time scale. These paths form a statistical weight distribution—this is precisely the physical origin of the squared modulus of the quantum probability amplitude, |ψ|².

Such a Hamiltonian form and the energy distribution snapshot it embodies, in principle, offer the possibility of reconstructing the metric tensor and geodesic equation of general relativity (GR) from this microscopic foundation. Specifically:
The metric tensor g{μν} can emerge from the effective geometry defined by the spatial gradient of the SEQ resonance frequency ωᵢ and the topological correlation of the resonance axis vectors n̂(i), reflecting the previously mentioned frequency–geometry duality:
ω_QFT = f((g{μν})_GR)

The geodesic equation may correspond to the macroscopic continuous limit of the maximum entropy path selection principle and minimum action path selection.

From the perspective of an energy-distribution snapshot, both the Hamiltonian and the system’s evolution are transparent in this model; turning this insight into a practical toolkit, however, demands implementing hierarchical coarse-graining and renormalization—a route whose first exploratory steps will be sketched in Section 15.9.

However, rigorously constructing this bridge involves advanced tools from differential geometry, statistical mechanics, and field theory. Therefore, its full development is best undertaken by a collaborative team of professional physicists.
